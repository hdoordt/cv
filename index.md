## About me

Hi, my name is Henk. Nice that you're having a look at my resume! 

## Professional experience

 - **2018 - present:** *Embedded/backend developer at Tweede Golf*
 
 My current employment at Tweede Golf is very diverse. I work on a multitude of projects, both web related and embedded. As an embedded developer, I gained a lot of knowledge on bare-metal driver development and embedded application development in Rust. Backend development at Tweede Golf means creating custom web applications using Typescript (Node, React) and Rust, as well as working with Kubernetes to deploy applications to our cluster. I oversee the client communication and scrum-master like tasks at some of the projects I work on. Apart from software development and leading projects, I hosted workshops on embedded Rust both internally and for external partner companies.

 At Baksteen, I designed and implemented decentralized applications (Dappss) for Ethereum, using the Solididy smart contract programming language. Most notably, I worked on Divisions, a fully decentralized proof of stake pooling platform. As project lead, I oversaw a team of five developers.

 - **2016:** *Internship at New Nexus Mobile*
 
 From my time at New Nexus Mobile, I gained experience in app development for both iOS and Android using Xamarin and C#. I worked at an app that enables users to send text, photo, video and voice messages to the future. The app's user interface is full of custom elements and micro-animations.

 - **2015 - 2017:** *Software developer at Rocketry*
 
 As a developer at Rocketry, I fulfilled a role as all-round IT-specialist. My main focus was on building a fully automated domain name webshop and designing and developing a crypto currency trading bot.
